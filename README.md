### Introduction 
The rules of tic tac toe are fairly straightforward. Below is a comprehensive list of the noughts and crosses game rules:

* The game requires two players, X and O.
* The game board is a set 3x3 grid in which players will place their symbol to claim that segment.
* X typically players first, then players alternate turns.
* The goal is to claim three segments of the grid in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* The game is over either when one player achieves three segments in a row, or when the grid is filled without anyone achieving three segments in a row.
